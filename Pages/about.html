    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Southside Baptist Church exists to glorify God by living out its mission: Love God, Love People, Disciple the World. We are a community of believers who seek to grow in our relationship with God through worship, prayer, and the study of His Word. Our church is committed to creating an environment where individuals and families can encounter the transforming power of Jesus Christ and be equipped to live out their faith daily.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Guided by the love of Christ, we strive to show compassion to those around us, serving our neighbors and meeting the needs of our community. We believe that discipleship is not only about deepening personal faith but also about sharing the hope of the Gospel with the world. At Southside Baptist, our mission calls us to be active in both local outreach and global missions, embodying the love of Christ in everything we do.</p>
